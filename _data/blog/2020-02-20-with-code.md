The predictable flow of actions to a common store that then pushes the changes in React to update the view allows for predictable and *debuggable* sequences of operations that are easier to standardize in a team environment.

For every part of your code to which a project can have agreed upon guidelines will mean easier to understand code, a cleaner git history since every developer touching each file won't feel like they have to refactor to their own way.

### mapStateToProps

mapStateToProps is a little confusing at first, but upon closer inspection, it is just a simple function (no imported library) that simply returns a specified part of the current state.

```javascript
const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return { things: state.things };
};
```

a valid alternative to make easier to read is to destructure the state

```javascript
const mapStateToProps = ({ configuration }) => {
  return { colors: configuration.colors };
};
```

### mapDispatchToProps

Do this:

```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = {
  decrement: () => ({ type: "DECREMENT" }),
  increment: () => ({ type: "INCREMENT" })
};
```

instead of this:

```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    decrement: () => dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT" }),
    increment: () => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })
  };
};
```

The difference is that we rely on react-redux to inject dispatch on each value that is a function in our mapDispatchToProps object, rather than relying on react-redux to inject dispatch into our mapDispatchToProps function. This is the preferred way from the official react-redux documentation. <https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapdispatch#defining-mapdispatchtoprops-as-an-object>

### connect()

When used with the Redux connect() function to export a component such as:

```javascript
const mapStateToProps = ({ configuration }) => {
  return { colors: configuration.colors };
};

const mapDispatchToProps = {
  decrement: () => ({ type: "DECREMENT" }),
  increment: () => ({ type: "INCREMENT" })
};

export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(MyComponent);
```

we are exporting the combination of a component that is connected to the store. Think of connect() as the glue or interface between the component and the store. Any changes to the state will be reflected in the component because it is “connected” to mapStateToProps and that information is now made available to the component through a prop.
